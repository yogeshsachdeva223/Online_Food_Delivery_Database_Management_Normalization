# Online_Food_Delivery_Database_Management_Normalization

In this project, We have picked up a complex form data of online food delivery databse to extract pieces of information from this form and have Organized the extracted pieces of information (attributes) into a table. We have followed these steps:

i)  Normalize the resulting table following rules of normalization upto 3NF. In this process, we have make certain assumptions about some attributes or about relationship among them, which have been clearly statted in the project.
ii) Translate the tables to mysql (SQL) code usig Data Definition language. Select suitable data types.
iii) Apply proper database constraints to attributes in the coded tables.
iv) Create various users of database. Define their roles and assign them proper suthority. Translate these roles to mysql-code using SQL Data Control language.
v) Run the code in MySQL server to create all objects and users with proper role-definitions.
vi) Use MySQL server Workbench to create an ER-diagram.
vii) Finally prepared the report.

This repositery containsL  a) The starting form, b) Normalized tables--step-by-step, c) An SQL file with SQL code, d) ER diagram e) Report containing your case, assumptions etc.
